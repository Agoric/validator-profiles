To receive and maintain delegation from the Agoric OpCo, I, [Nodes.Guru](https://stake.nodes.guru) hereby commit to the following work and support for the benefit of the Agoric Network and Community. If, for any reason, I do not meet these commitments then I understand that I may lose delegation staked to me by the Agoric Operations Company and/or any other associated organizations. :

1. The hardware my node will run meets the requirements detailed in the [Agoric Validator Runbooks](https://github.com/Agoric/agoric-sdk/wiki/Runbook:-Recommended-Hardware-Baseline-for-Node-Operation)

2. My node will have an uptime of at least 95%

3. I will set a reasonable commission rate between 3% to 10%

4. I commit to not exceed 10% voting power

5. I will actively participate in security and upgrade governance proposals found on [Commonwealth.im](https://commonwealth.im/agoric)

6. I will report bugs I discover through the process described in the [Agoric Reporting a Security Bug Runbook](https://github.com/Agoric/agoric-sdk/wiki/Runbook:-Reporting-a-Security-Bug)

8. I will notify impacted parties in case of node outage.

9. I will strive to capture and share observability metrics to help diagnose and troubleshoot network and node performance issues

10. I commit to network contributions listed below:

Category 1: Infrastructure
